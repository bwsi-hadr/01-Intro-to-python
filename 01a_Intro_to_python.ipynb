        "- numpy\n",
        "- pandas\n",
        "- matplotlib\n",
        "\n",
        "## Importing packages\n",
        "Packages are collections of pre-written code made available for reuse. In the previous lesson, we installed some necessary packages using the `pip` python package manager. Packages are convenient because they save you from having to implement every feature and function on your own. The widely-used packages also provide a standard, common set of tools for others to develop with --- allowing interoperability between programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a few different ways to import  package in python:\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest is just to `import {packagename}`. For this lesson, we'll use `numpy` as the example package\n",
        "```\n",
        "import numpy\n",
        "```\n",
        "The functions, classes, and variables of the `numpy` package can then be accessed using \"dot\" notation: for example, the numpy array class can be accessed with `numpy.array`\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "A variant of this is to use `import {packagename} as {shortname}`, as in:\n",
        "```\n",
        "import numpy as np\n",
        "```\n",
        "This reduces the number of characters needed to type, and can be convenient if the package name is long, or you need to use many things from the same package. Accessing the numpy array class, for example, can be done with ```np.array```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "If you only need a subset of items from a package, for example, a single class, function, or a submodule (subpackage of the main package), you can use the syntax ``` from {packagename} import {element}```, as in:\n",
        "```\n",
        "from numpy import array\n",
        "```\n",
        "This allows you to use the `array` class directly, without importing the rest of the numpy package, and without needing to use the package prefix dot notation.\n",
        "For example, if you use this import method, then writing\n",
        "```\n",
        "test_array = array([0])\n",
        "```\n",
        "would be equivalent to writing\n",
